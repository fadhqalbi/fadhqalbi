👋👀 Hi, I am **Fadhilah** 
--
I have a background in Biomedical Engineering and am skilled in biomedical signal processing. In particular, I am passionate about the development of healthcare technology and information.

Currently, I am seeking opportunities to collaborate in **medical informatics** or **data science and analytics** related to health and medicine

The last few months, I have been studying web programming for fun, and I have also learned a bit about UI/UX design as I worked on my first web application: _[School Management System](https://github.com/fadhqalbi/siramanager-v1.git)_

You can reach me through this **[link](https://fadhqalbi.com/)**
